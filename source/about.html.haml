        %h3 Our story starts in a storage closet.
        In 2005, Bryan Carter struck out on his own. He set up shop in a storage closet in his dad’s accounting office. At the time, iR had one client, a phone and a whiteboard. Today, iR is a national company with a fully dedicated team. We serve over 200 clients in the U.S., including our very first, who is still with us today.
